:3d0:AARGH!
:3d1:SCREW IT!!!
:3d2:Looks like I'm lucky that I haven't brought this gun back home!! Can't say you're in luck, though.
:3d3:H-hey! We still have one track left, what's up with you?
:3d4:Why don't you just... relax?
:3d5:Last track in my mixtape... And the last track YOU'LL EVER HEAR IN YOUR LIFE!!!
:3d6:Try me. At least I don't need a gun to prove someone wrong.
